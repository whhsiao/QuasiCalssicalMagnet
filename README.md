# QuasiCalssicalMagnet
We simulate the magnetic order of some quasi-classical magnets on an 1D chain.
## Long range order in low dimensional systems
A very well known result in statistical physics is the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which states there can't be spontaneous symmetry breaking in dimension smaller than 3. I first knew about this statement some when I was in college, but have been overlooking one important condition -- the range of interaction most be "short enough." 
Because of this condition, there is no contradiction between this theorem and the spontaneously generated mass of photon in (1+1)D (as far as I understand it).
In this project, I am going to study some simple examples that demonstrate this phenomenon.
## Classical XY model
## Long-ranged Ising model
